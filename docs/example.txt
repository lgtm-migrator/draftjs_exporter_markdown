## draftjs_exporter is an HTML exporter for [Draft.js](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js) content

> Try it out by running this file!

### Features üìùüç∏

The exporter aims to provide sensible defaults from basic block types and inline styles to HTML, that can easily be customised when required. For more advanced scenarios, an API is provided (mimicking React's [`createElement`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.createelement)) to create custom rendering components of arbitrary complexity.

1. It has no dependencies
2. And is performance-tuned

---

Here are some features worth highlighting:

* Convert line breaks to `<br>`
elements.
* Automatic conversion of entity data to HTML attributes (int & boolean to string, [`style object` to `style string`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)).
* Wrapped blocks (`<li> `elements go inside `<ul>` or `<ol>`).
  * With arbitrary nesting.
    * Common text styles: **Bold**, _Italic_, <u>Underline</u>, `Monospace`, ~Strikethrough.~ <kbd>cmd + b</kbd>
    * ~Overlapping ~**~te~****_xt_**_ styles. _Custom styles too!
      * #hashtag support via [#CompositeDecorators](https://github.com/springload/draftjs_exporter/pull/17).
        * Linkify URLs too! http://example.com/
